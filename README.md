# Text-Adventure
A Sci-Fi Horror Text Adventure for Android

Consisting of a mere 5 rooms (Bridge, Mess Hall, Armory, Brig, and Captains Quarters) and 5 commands (attack, go, look, take, save),
much more hard coding needs to be done (or hopefully a way to create rooms more efficiently can to be devised).
Desired Readability Improvements: Separate MainActivity from the Text Adventure model or structure
Desired Gameplay Improvements: Many more Rooms, Weapons, and things to save. Not an instant game over if you enter a room with an enemy
with higher defense than your attack power. (Health possibly, perhaps some random chance in terms of attack power. i.e. it just makes it 
very unlikely that you will beat a high defense enemy with a low attack weapon)
Desired Story Improvements: Need more. (conclusion, simply a longer plot)
Desired Visual Improvements: App icon picture, larger, more interesting font, more colors
Long Term Goals: Add audio, images, choices matter. Retain High Scores. Save Games, be able to load saves.
